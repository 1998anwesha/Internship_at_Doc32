# Head pose estimation and Smile detection

Please refer to the [report](https://github.com/1998anwesha/dentalcare/blob/master/Internship%20Report%20Doc32.pdf) for a summary of tasks performed during my internship at Doc32 (Abita Health Care Pvt. Ltd).

Primarily my tasks were:
1) Developing a head pose estimator for head alignment towards the camera - utilizing Dlib landmarks and projecting a 3D pointer from the nose
2) Using Opencv functions like solvepnp and projectpoints for projecting nose coordinate onto the camera frame
3) We display relevant instructions to the patient depending on head tilt angle.
4) Using smile detection algorithm to extract region of interest for diagnostic purposes.
5) Comparing template/feature mathing algorithm efficiency.
6) Sentiment analysis on Instagram comments
